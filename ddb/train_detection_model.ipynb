    "# Train Detection Model\n",
    "\n",
    "I used transfer learning with different models from [Tensorflow's detection model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md) to train my detection model. I started with the ssd_inception_v2_coco model for proof of concept with the Tensorflow Object Detection API Tutorial, which notes that it has a nice tradeoff between performance and speed. I also tried the faster_rcnn_resnet101_fgvc model, which is trained on the iNaturalist Species dataset and the faster_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_oidv2 model, which is trained on Open Images dataset. The ssd_inception_v2_coco model is trained on the COCO dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "After untracking my pre_trained_model directory from GitHub (the files are big), to get the pipeline for each model I downloaded the * .tar.gz file from Tensorflow's detection model zoo and extracted the contents into a folder in my pre_trained_model directory. "
